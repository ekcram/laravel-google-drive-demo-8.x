# Laravel & Google Drive Storage

## Getting your Team Folder ID

If you want to store files in your Google Drive Team directory, then the folder can be empty.

Because Google Drive allows duplicate names, it identifies each file and folder with a unique ID. If you open your folder, you will see the **Folder ID** in the URL.
